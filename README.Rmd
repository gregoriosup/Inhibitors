# INHIBITORS PROJECT

### General informations

This project is the result of a scientific internship. The main researcher is Guilherme Henrique Gregório, an undergraduate student in Pharmacy at the University of São Paulo (USP). The research is carried out at the Faculty of Medicine with the guidance of Dr. Suzane Kioko Ono. This study aims to assess whether patients with slow tacrolimus metabolism using CYP3A4 inhibitors are more associated with tacrolimus intoxication. In addition, we are working toward assessing the effect of genotype CYP3A5, tacrolimus baseline serum, tacrolimus dose, hematocrit, and inhibitor use to predict tacrolimus serum during inhibitors use.
